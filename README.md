Repository containing code corresponding to the lab assignments and final project of the Machine learning in healthcare course. Fall 2023.

## Lab 1

Implementation of an MVAE (multi-view variational autoencoder), capable of learning meaningful, disentangled latent representations from multiple views or modalities.

## Lab 2

Complete survival analysis project using Kaplan-Meier and Cox-Hazard models on latent representations of data obtained through UMAP based on subgroups found through mixture models maximizing bayesian information criterion


## Final project

 + Title: **Unsupervised analysis of the relationship between various genetic polymorphisms and their relationship to impulse-aggresiveness personality traits**
